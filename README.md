## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Initially I found it a little overwhelming navigating the Xcode interface and I was shocked at how intricate the UI was. I eventually came to terms with the fact that I will take it step by step and become a master in it, just as I was shocked with VS Code when I first started out, Xcode interface will also be understood like the back of my hand. As for implementing my code and building my application, there were no difficulties there, I had a lot of fun trying out Swift and coding in a new langauge!
