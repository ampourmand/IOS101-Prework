## App Idea: Mindful Habit Tracker: Mystic Grove

**Description:**  

Mystic Grove is a habit-tracking app set in a medieval fantasy world where users build and grow their own enchanted forest or village by completing daily habits. Each completed habit adds resources and unlocks new areas, magical creatures, and items. Users start with a small patch of land that transforms into a thriving realm as they maintain their routines. The app features visually engaging graphics, daily challenges, and special events like “Harvest Festivals” to motivate progress. Guided “wisdom scrolls” encourage reflection on personal growth, while social features allow users to visit and interact with friends’ realms, share resources, and take on collaborative quests.

## Notes

I developed a simple color-changing app in Swift, which was an awesome experience and I'm motivated to dive deeper into iOS development. I initially found Xcode’s intricate UI overwhelming, but I took it step by step, just like I did when I first learned VS Code. Implementing the app’s functionality was smooth and fun, and I really enjoyed coding in Swift. Also, adjusting to the new development environment and workflow was a bit overwhelming at first, especially switching between the interface and coding. Nonetheless, I am very excited to continually better my iOS development skills and work on some amazing projects!
